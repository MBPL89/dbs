Great staff, clean rooms, and very comfortable beds. So, I’d light to highlight great customer service from Lala. Every time I make a reservation to any hotel, I request non feather bedding because of my allergies. I simply cannot deal with donald or daffy. And every single time, the hotels over look this request. Lala read the request and personally checked the room as I unloaded the car to make sure that the geese were elsewhere. That’s service people! Hotels with far more stars don’t have that kind of accountability and person touch. I have no quarms about recommending this place. GPS totally missed this place so be sure to be on the side of katy freeway heading east toward the beltway. Its next to texas land and cattle and holiday inn.

I travel 4 days a week for work, and think I have a pretty good grasp on the hotel scene in the US and can provide an objective comparison. This property, supposedly fresh off a renovation, looks like a sad, dingy, rundown place. Issues I have ran into during only 24 hours of being here: - Room key card machine broke down for about an hour. Unable to check in to room or go to the gym, had to have a guy escort me around with a master key - First room I got was next to the elevator banks. Huge bangs heard every 10min, had to ask them to switch my rooms, which I do say is a plus, they handled well and I got a room further from the elevators - This property of 21 or so floors has 4 very old and scary elevators. Don’t be surprised that the average wait can easily be 10-15min to just get out of the building. Oh, and this morning 3 of the 4 elevators WERE OUT OF SERVICE, you can imagine the chaos it caused, and how fun it is to walk up and down to the 11th floor - No ironing board, no iron, no hairdrier, no luggage rack, no coat hanger of any sort in the room.... They must have done furnishing in a hurry... - Toilet overflow - The toilet appears to flush, and then 2min later everything that you thought you flushed down, appears again. Then if you are lucky, 3 or so flushes later, the stuff finally goes down... - Dirty (dark brown on the bottom) bathtub with lot of leftover hair hanging out in it, nasty; makes me question how clean is the rest of the room - Ordered one salad entree through room service, got a completly different salad entree. Ate it without complaint, but how hard is it to get one order right? I am glad I am checking out in 10 hours from this nightmare, before anything else breaks or goes wrong. It’s especially unfortunate because Starwood typically has excellent properties associated with its name, I highly suggest they revisit their choice. Travelers - save your money, if you are in the area go to the Aloft; nice, clean, and organized property.',99135,00000000091),

The ’’king size’’ bed is a small king, so plan accordingly. It has nice little touches to make the rooms homey - little reflective paint under counter in bathroom so turning on the light at night is unnecessary; shelving in the tub to hold towels; hutch for microwave and refrigerator with room for storage. We ate the breakfast and it was good - not great, but as it was included in our price, we won’t complain. Sausage gravy and biscuits, eggs, bacon, cereals, fresh fruits, pastries, yogurt, french toast, pancakes, hash browns, coffee, juice, and am probably leaving something out. We received a special rate due to the meet we were attending and it included breakfast.

Every morning, we were greeted with a delicious breakfast bar filled with scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, waffles, bagels, fruit, coffee, juice, cold cereal, hot cereal, and more--it was wonderful! Plus, we had free bottled water available to us at all times and they have a happy hour at 5pm where we would start our evening with a few glasses of wine and snacks. The staff was personable and helpful. We especially got to know Sonny--he’s the man to see when in Houston. He recommended 3 restaurants to us and they were all outstanding. I had the best steak I’ve ever had and Sonny pointed the way! He drove the shuttle van and took us where we need to go. Our other colleagues stayed at the Hilton, Hyatt, and Crowne Plaza. Little ’ole Best Western had them all beat!!! Our stay cost about 1/3 less and we had all the great perks!! One colleague commented that her bottled water was $3.50 at the Hilton.

Nice bathroom, and probably the BEST king bed I’ve slept in at any hotel of recent memory. Only direct complaint is the $25-ish overnight valet parking charge, which seems crazy. Beware that this hotel is in a dead zone for [AT&T] cell service. Couldn’t keep a call with signal hovering between 0-1 bars. Not the hotel’s fault, I lose calls always driving this stretch of Main/San Jacinto. I checked in very late and had to leave very early so I didn’t get to really enjoy the accomodation as much as I would have liked. But I look forward to my next stay there.

I think it’s time for the hotel to invest in these upgrades as their peers have already done. Nice location with lots of restaurant options in walking distance. This is also another downtown hotel with no option but for valet parking and the $25-ish charge seems unnecessarily high.

The hotel is located just off a major freeway/frontage road. The hotel offers plenty of convenient and free parking. I was greeted with a smile, welcomed by name, and my check-in took less than a minute. The hotel itself is very clean and well-maintained. The hotel caters to business travelers and at least in the early evening the lobby/bar area is fairly noisy. My room was on the sixth floor and was also very clean, with a spotless duvet and a very comfortable bed. I am a long-time Hilton Diamond HHonors member, and virtually all of my domestic hotel stays are at HGI properties for reasons (as in this case) include: free and convenient parking, free high-speed internet, a free and well-equipped business center, a clean indoor pool and a free and well-equipped fitness center, and a restaurant offering good food at reasonable prices. If you like to workout, I recommend that you get to the fitness center as early as you can because the place fills up fast.  The property, its staff, my room, and all of the usual HGI amenities made for a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. I recommend this property to you.',1158926,00000000077),
(00094748006,'2011-01-28','January',2011,0,'F',3,4,5,3,2,3,'Very convenient to Airport - But Expensive','As always, making my reservation took less than 3 minutes using the Hilton website. The hotel is located just a couple of minutes from the Austin airport and it’s that location that is the best (and possibly only) thing that recommends this hotel. On the other hand, the Hilton Garden Inn and Hilton in downtown Austin (I checked them both out as they are located near each other) would have been unaccetpable as there were homeless people wandering around both of the downtown hotels and their location next to the freeway placed them in a congested, noisy, and fairly unattractive location. So, it was the Airport Hilton for me. The hotel is maybe a 15 minute drive from downtown. As has sadly been the trend with Hiltons over the last few years, staying at this hotel involves being nickled and dimed from the minute you arrive. You’ll pay to park, whether using the valet parking or self-parking. Similarly, in-room internet and/or internet in the business center is charged for.  The front desk staff was slow, and appeared confused - initially I was checked into and given a key for a room reserved for some other guest. Total check-in time was about 10 minutes, way too long given that I was the only person checking in at the time. The hotel itself is in the shape of a drum, with a large circular atrium. There are two rings of rooms, one with ’’views’’ only of the atrium, while the other ring has rooms that have outside views (either of a freeway or the airport). My room was on the fourth floor (top floor) and was clean with a duvet and a very comfortable matress for bedding. HVAC was quite powerful and made cooling off the room fast and easy. This hotel offers a large and well-equipped fitness center. Water pressure from the shower was anemic and it took a long time to get the soap off given the trickle of water the shower produced. Check-out the next morning was again a slow process (the night auditor rather than a front desk person) but due to the location of the hotel, I was at the airport in less than five minutes. Overall, what you are paying for at this Hilton property is location and the fact that the hotel is literally on the grounds of the airport. Otherwise, I found this hotel to be expensive for the product (room) offered, exacerbated by the additional charges for parking and internet access that are free at other Hilton brands like the Hilton Garden Inns.  I can recommend this property, but it’s a close call, with my recommendation based almost entirely on the hotel’s location adjacent to the airport.',223686,00000000077),

This Hampton lived up to and/or exceeded the reviews and my own expectations. I had a ’’junior suite’’ on the 5th floor of this new 6 floor hotel. I recommend you pay the small additional amount for the huge space and comfort the junior suites offer. I found it to be an excellent value. There is plenty of free and convenient parking. The hotel is set back from roads and well away from the freeway, so the setting is very quiet. Check-in took less than a minute and the two guys on the front desk were friendly and yet professional. The main floor offers a free business center, guest laundry, and fitness center, along with an area where the hotel offers a free breakfast. All common areas were ’’like new’’. My own room was clean and well maintained. What I especially liked was the work desk chair which, unlike the hard-as-a-rock chairs in HGI properties, was a very comfortable and nicely padded chair. The bathroom was clean and well stocked. My bedding (duvet) was spotless and comfortable and provided a great night’s sleep. The small coffee/sink area was similarly spotless and what I liked was that Hampton offers coffee/water cups that are single-use and sealed in plastic bags - there is no wondering whether housekeeping really cleaned/replaced the glasses/coffee cups. The rooms also feature a small fridge, a microwave, and a large HD flat panel TV. While the location is not in the central/core of Columbus, and is perhaps 15 - 20 minutes from the airport, I found the location to be perfect for my needs. And in all respects, this Hampton Inn was everything and more that previous reviewers have mentioned as positives. I have been staying at Hilton properties for nearly 35 years and I am a long-standing Diamond HHonors member. I can honestly say that this Hampton ranks at or near the top among all of the Hilton-branded properties I’ve stayed at. I strongly recommend this hotel to you!',878115,00000000077),

Before booking a room for four nights at the Best Western Downtown Inn and Suites, I read some reviews about this and other hotels on the downtown zone (Doubletree, Marriot Courtyard, etc.) and I’m glad to say that all of the good comments that were written about BW are true. The hotel is located right oustide the Houston downtown, but outside doesn’t mean far. The few times I decided to walk to the downtown, a 15-minutes walk took me to the heart of it. If you aren’t a walkiing person, the shuttle of the hotel will take you anywhere within the downtown area or even to the midtown if the distance isn’t too far.  The rooms are clean, spacious and very well equipped with an iron, a coffee maker, the basic bathroom amenities, satellital TV and as many bottles of water as you can drink. It also has a microwave and a small fridge, which makes your stay even more comfortable. Vending machines are avaiable to get microwave food and sodas whenever you want. The best of the hotel is the staff: Jo, the front-desk lady is just lovely and helpful. Sonny (the multi-task guy of the business) is always ready to give you a ride on the shuttle or to recommend you the hot spots to hang out at night. There is a third front-desk guy called Don, that kindly took us to a Walgreen’s like 20 blocks away from the hotel in his own car, as the shuttle only works from Monday to Friday. That was something nice I didn’t expect. The breakfast is simple but effective: waffles, sweet bread, cereal, milk, coffee, eggs, sausages and bacon. They serve the same breakfast everyday, so try to ’’rotate’’ your choices if you are staying more than one night and you don’t like to have the same everyday. The hotel is totally non-smoking. If you are a nicotine addict, DON’T DO IT INSIDE the rooms. During our stay, we saw two guys being kindly kicked out of the hotel after paying a $ 250.00 fine for smoking inside. The only thing I didn’t like were the pillows. They were too large and squishy and it’s the only kind of pillows they have, so if you are a ’’firm’’ pillows user like me, you will have to bring yours.

If you are a Hilton HHonors member, there are other, likely better Hilton-brand options to consider (like the Embassy Suites North or the Hilton Garden Inn - I’ve stayed at both hotels and they are good options). If you are not tied to the Hilton family of hotels, there are probably much better options located close to the hotel. Getting to the hotel from LAX is via shuttle bus. The hotel no longer operates its own shuttle, but uses a contractor. Shuttles serve more than one hotel. The buses are old, loud, and uncomfortable. The shuttle makes its first stop at the Hilton; on the way to the airport, you will make at least one stop at another hotel. Keep this in mind when planning out how long it will take you to get back to the airport. When the shuttle arrives at the hotel, it’s a race to the checkin counter at the back of the hotel. If you’re slow, you will wait to check in. My checkin took about 10 minutes and was handled in a competent if not particularly welcoming manner. This Hilton is tired. When was the last time you had a room with an old-style television with a picture tube? The hotel hasn’t upgraded to flat panel televisions. Common areas are worn down. My room was dark and small, with what felt like a very low ceiling. The walls were scuffed, wall paper was peeling away, and the bathroom was cramped and not particularly clean. The room’s HVAC system was anemic and the construction of the building allowed noise (jets taking off) into the room, making sleep difficult. My bottom line is that this hotel is only acceptable when transiting LAX (which I was doing) and solely on the basis of its location so close to LAX. In any event, the hotel’s owners need to invest in refurbishing/updating this property. The Hilton LAX has a lot of potential; it’s sad that it doesn’t come close to meeting that potential.',84167,00000000077),

The front desk manager Lolita was a pleasure to get to know. She always had a huge smile on her face and teased me right back when I teased her; however, she needed help on the weekend we stayed. On to my complaints: 1. Our room was never cleaned or refreshed. I had two daughters with me for a soccer tournament, and we returned at around 9 pm on Saturday night from a long day of soccer. We were worn out and needed to eat something and get the kids into bed. Upon arrival, we decided to eat something in the restaurant/bar area. The food was really good, but it took forever. Every time I walked through the lobby area, there was a check in line that stretched from the front desk literally out the front door. Poor Lolita was the only person there to check all of these people in. I am not kidding. the line was there from the time we entered till the time we finally went to bed.  2. Anyway, we finally got to our room, and the key didn’t work. I knew I was going to have to go and stand in that line, and I was not happy. I went and stood in the line for 15 minutes. Lolita was apologetic and gave us new keys.  3. When we finally got into our room sometime around 10:30, we arrived only to find that the room had never been cleaned. All of our towels were dirty from the morning before, and my kids and I desperately needed a shower. I called housekeeping...no answer. I think I left a message, but it has been a while. Anyway, I finally called Lolita. I told her that we desperately needed towels. I asked if I could come down and get some. She said that she would have someone bring them. My kids showered and used dirty towels. The clean towels never came.  4. The next morning upon checkout, I let the front desk manager know of our experience the night before. His response was that it was the weekend, and they only have 1/2 of the usual staff. I was stunned and nicely told him that was not an acceptable excuse.  5. One last item, the bathrooms are tiny. I have never seen a smaller commode. I am not a huge person, and I could not sit on the seat without my feces landing on the commode seat. I commented on this to another member of our party who stayed, and they laughed about having the exact same experience.  6. Finally, there was a seedy group of people hanging around the parking lot and lobby of this hotel. I am pretty sure there were prostitutes turning tricks in the bar area the night we were there. No, I am not joking. It is not a very friendly hotel for kids.  This hotel does not deserve a 3 star rating. I give it a 2 on a good day.',98964,00000000066),

Some staff are increadibly helpful while others are not. For example, wanting a cup of coffee around 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon we discovered it was cold. When we told the front desk about it, their reply was that we would have to wait a couple of hours until the new shift came on duty. What?! Room service was also slow on some days. We had to wait until 5:30 pm on a Sunday to get a maid to make up our room. On the upside, the breakfast is very nice at a cost of $10 per person. There are cookies in the lobby in the afternoon.

The rooms are well appointed although the common areas were a bit dirty and I don’t think the halls ever got vacuumed.

The property seems charming enough, some might consider the 50’s/60’s California Ranch style ’’dated’’ but I consider it classic, but truthfully we didn’t have time to explore beyond our room, main lobby, and veranda (restaurant & bar space), and we didn’t play golf, use the spa or enjoy any of the property’s amenities, including what appears to be a nice kid’s program. So why are we disappointed? By the weak service of waitstaff and lack of service by front desk/security/valet staff handling (or lack thereof) of our complaints over two nights. Our first night was marred by a car alarm that went off ALL NIGHT LONG, a beep-beep-beep that cycled on for a couple minutes, off for maybe 10-30 minutes, then on again. First call to front desk was they’d send security. My second call was answered by someone who had just come on and didn’t know anything about it but would send security. I slept through the alarms until the one that woke me at 5:30 am but my wife had not slept. So I walked to the front desk and the gal there said she didn’t know anything about it but then jumped on the radio to someone saying ’’what do you know about that black Honda Civic in Valet with the alarm that’s been going off?’’ Nice. Second night, and unbelievably, another car alarm was going off into the night, this one being one of those with six different alarm sounds. Thank God it ended sometime after midnight, maybe that’s when the offender who had self-parked his pickup truck in the valet lot and left, returned. First call, they’ll send security. Second call was met with hostility, ’’there’s nothing we can do, valet doesn’t have a key, we’ve looked in the bar and asked everyone if it’s their truck. Sorry, let’s just hope the owner comes back.’’ Third was an in-person visit to the front desk who says I’m the only one complaining about it. He radios the valet who says sorry, he didn’t find keys or the owner and he’s off in 5 minutes so he can’t help’’ but they’ll send security, give them a little more time, and they’ll call me and tell me what they’re going to do. No call... ...no apologies, no offer to move us to another room, or comp us, or offer SOMETHING.  We (including coworkers) had cocktails on the veranda 3 times and 3 times waitstaff was inattentive, one time disappearing with my wife’s credit card and had to be located after we waited 30 minutes.for her return. We stayed at a corporate-discounted room rate. I guess that’s why we ended up in the ’’Terraces’’, the rooms that are outward-facing, towards the parking lots, on the perimeter of the resort (and why we were not offered a relocation?). Nice rooms, well-appointed, with attractive casework for dresser, desk and 42’’ plasma with digital LodgeNet, and another nice piece which set the king bed at a 45-degree angle, and with integrated night lighting. If the rest of the resort has this level of appointment then you’ll be fine.

(Each basket was made for each family in mind.) We’re off to a great start! Then, following my dad’s birthday celebration at Texas Land and Cattle (already heard that story, did ya?).....we all went back to the hotel and we took over the bar area, stayed around past the time the bar was to close and the bartender told us...no problem! No Problem....I’m sorry, I am just not used to that selfless, customer service oriented behavior....AMAZING!!!!!  Friday....family and friends still arriving...hotel handling everything smoothly. Shuttle took family and friends to the mall and picked them up again....and was prompt! I arrived at 3:00 to begin decorating the hall. Jennifer is the event planner for the hotel. Another ’’Can Do’’ person. How could there possibly be that many GOOD people in one place?

The hotel is immediately across a side-street from the SD Convention Center, on an embarcardero across Harbor Drive from the Gaslamp area, on the San Diego Bay. Orientation of the hotel is E-W (so rooms face either north or south). Our 23rd-floor room faced south, providing a perfect view of...the Dole (as in fruits) freight yard immediately to the south of the property, where a freighter that was in port was being worked the whole time we were there. It actually wasn’t offensive to look at, as the operations were neat and orderly. But we were poolside one afternoon and the engine/generator noise coming from the freighter was a little more pronounced than just white noise in the background.

Expansive open spaces, tall ceilings, lots of wood and stone surfaces, escalators to move you up and down to the street level, and meeting rooms right off the lobby. It’s clearly not catering to kids (though there were many families there) and that was just fine. The pool is a token pool, not very large, not intended for all-day leisure.

I like the challenge of finding 5-star deals on a budget. When I also manage to get the same exceptional service and attention as those who can easily afford such luxury, it’s a very rare combination indeed. But the Sherry hit a home run on both counts and I think that I’ve found my special go-to place to stay. From the youngest to the oldest employee, from the early morning/late night front desk staff to every single elevator captain and bellop, ALL were unfailingly polite and cheerful! You really get the sense that they love their jobs and they are super happy to serve. Each time my mother and I came through the door, I felt as though we were truly welcomed ’’home’’. In fact, it got to be nothing to just hang out in the lobby and get the best tips on where to shop or get the best coffee and brunch. I am serious...this staff can give the top hotels in NYC some lessons in true hospitality. Room 211, which I think was a wonderful upgrade on their part, is fit for any special occasion. Spacious, beautifully appointed with a big screen TV and a gazillion cable stations, a wonderful large bathroom, lots of light , and a birds-eye view of the CBS Early Show studio....not to mention a corner of the famous corner anchored by The Plaza Hotel. There were times when we just felt like ’’staying put’’, but we didn’t miss out on the buzz of the city. It was right outside to see! Want to get away quick? The subway stop is right around the corner of the hotel. You can be in Union Square (HUGE Filene’s and Whole Foods Market) in less than 25-minutes. Feel like you need to commit to an East Side -vs-West Side experience? Don’t bother. You can do both without much effort with cabs and cross-town buses all around -- not to mention horse drawn carriages. An escape to the more magical? Famous Central Park, which can seem postively other-worldly in the quiet morning sunlight, is steps aways. When in NYC, we usually stay at The Casablanca, The Elysee, and The Lucerne. Each has a lot to recommend it. But I honestly have to say that I am going to take time to check out the Sherry first before I look elsewhere from now on.

I think it may be because the only times I am ever there is for soccer tournaments, and all those kids can make an adult a little cranky. I heard several of the staff arguing with parents who were asking for late checkouts on the last day of play. I remember having the same problem before, but it was not an issue for me this time. I heard quite a few parents complaining who were not with our team. I heard the front desk staff telling people that no more than two rooms per team could have a late checkout. I also heard the front desk staff talking negatively about parents as they left. A bit unprofessional. Personally, my only complaint was that I did not get the double beds that I called and asked for. I called about 5 days before my arrival, and they confirmed that the room would be double/double. I know with Priceline there is no guarantee on what kind of room you get, but I was a bit disappointed. They did, however, provide a king room with a couch pullout. It worked just fine for us although the couch was a bit uncomfortable. The food is always good at the restaurant, and the pool was adequate.

He transfers me to the front desk who tell me, well, we’ll see if we have any king bed rooms....WHAT?

I’m not entirely sure I’d recommend it for family travelers or those not traveling for business to Chicago. Your feet will hurt just walking from one part of the hotel to the other! The conference rooms and exhibit areas were very large and modern; I will say that the layout is confusing despite the multiple signs and color coded levels at the hotel.  I stayed in ’’floating king’’ room with a great view of the river and water. I highly recommend that room set up, because it is different and good use of the space. The room was small, but if you don’t spend a ton of time in there, it shouldn’t matter. I thought the layout was really cool and sort of unexpected; something different and fun for my stay here. I was on the 30th floor. We ate at the main restaurant and cafe twice and the buffet was good quality and lots of options. I liked the quesadillas very much. Big Bar upstairs was really loud and fun, everyone has a good time up there. Prices at both places are to be expected. The room service for breakfast was very very expensive. I had toast, fruit and coffee and it was $30. Recommend eating downstairs and grabbing a quick bit of fruit, Starbucks, and something else to save some cash. Location is good but not next to ’everything’ - you are within walking distance of Milennium Park and a bit farther to Michigan Avenue shopping. Otherwise a $6 cabride to the shops. The river area is really cool to be near, and views of the cool architecture was nice to have as well. I’ve said it is more of a business location versus vacation location for that reason. I’d recommended going closer to the shopping and train lines if you’re coming to Chicago on vacation. I think the closest train stop was Lake/Clark and it was about 1-mile. So I took the El from O’Hare and then taxi to the hotel (total cost $8). All of the people I came in touch with - room service, wait staff, concierge, check-in desk, folks answering the phone, etc - were very professional and helpful. I did not have a bad experience at any staff. Only other Chicago tip I can share: beware of the cab drivers and ask before you climb inside the car whether they take credit cards.

Check-in - friendly enough but nothing special no welcome back etc, interestingly some colleagues didn’t get the free breakfast coupons that come with our company rate here - arguements ensued and end result they didn’t get them apparently because they had booked through an agent ...........just as I had and received them - get it sorted guys !

We were on the 17th floor w/ not much of a view and some minor street noise, but never anything disruptive. The staff were always smiling, helpful, and competent. And to top it off, the location cannot be beat--close to every thing we wanted to see and do: Rockefeller Center, the 5th Ave shops, hansom cab rides, tea at The Plaza, etc.  If you’re looking for 24 hour room service and a grand lobby, this is not the place for you. But if you want a nice, clean, convenient place to relax between outings, this place more than fits the bill. Overall, I’d definitely return to this hotel and heartily recommend it to anyone visiting NYC.',80112,00000000103),

The hotel lobby, ’’Bistro’’, and rooms are pretty, clean, and spacious. The bed is slightly above average, but the bathroom are fabulous--more roomy than your usual discount hotel.  The problem at this hotel is the management and the staff. First time I stayed here the computers were down. Front desk staff takes my credit card and starts WRITING DOWN on a piece of paper the card #, expiration date, security code, and my name. When I expressed alarm, she said ’’oh we’re doing this with everyone until the computers are back up.’’ With that she waved an entire sheet of credit card info listing at least 5 or 6 people’s info who had just checked in. I was extremely leery but let her do it. This is AGAINST PCI and I’m sure Marriott would not be happy if they learned the hotel did this...could leave Marriott open to HUGE liability.  Second, I went down to the Bistro one evening about 7 pm to get a quesadilla. An employee comes out of the back, and the first thing he does is move dirty supplies off of a dirty food preparation counter, sort of tossing them aside to make room to work. Then he disappeared into ’’the back’’ and came out with a bag full of precooked chicken breasts. He proceeds to upend the bag over the DIRTY counter, dumping out one of the breasts. Then he grabs a knife that had been laying there lord knows how long, and starts to slice the chicken breast right on the dirty counter. Mind you--he had never cleaned or disinfected the counter before slicing my food on it. At least he was wearing gloves. He made the quesadilla and then put it in one of those quick steamheat ovens, and handed it over to me. I walked around a corner and tossed it in the trash. Yes I threw $9 away, but i’m on an expense account and I just didn’t feel like spending the next hour explaining food sanitation techniques. Needless to say, I will NEVER order another bite from that Bistro. GROSS,  I’ll probably continue to stay here--the rooms are nice, and the location is convenient. But I have zero faith in the staff--and the manager here needs to be replaced immediately.',1657341,00000000099),

The noise is due to the availability of many restaurants, shops, bars, and a cinema right next door. It is also due to these noisy hot-spots that you will also be treated to a great view of fountains with fire and beautifully lighted trees. We even saw a dance recital on the green, right from our window. The breakfast is good, much better than the danish and cold eggs at most chains. They provide specialty teas and coffees, high-end pastries, and fresh fruit. We have stayed here twice and can’t imagine why anyone would give Hotel Sorella bad ratings.',1200103,00000000121),

Hotels in New York are outrageously priced during the Christmas season. The San Carlos was a bargain. It is older, but nicely furnished. Similiar to a Marriott. Free breakfast in the morning(fresh pastries and bagels, yogurt), refrigerator in room, free wifi, business center and Aveda products in the bathroom. Beds were nice and comfortable and the room was much larger than ones at the W on Lexington. Nice diner across the street for quick meals; breakfast and afternoon snacks. Right near the Waldorf for drinks and easy subway access. Bellman made limo reservations for us to take us to and from the airport; otherwise 2 cabs were needed. Arranged a car service for us at night. Suites were $100 per night higher and had a full living room and kitchenette. Plenty of places nearby to get a drink. Staff was friendly and helpful. Have stayed at the Omni Berkshire and the Kimberly in the past which have more ambience but cost a lot more. Will stay here in the future for the price. Another reviewer complained about the poor lighting, plumbing rattle, view of wall and inadequate breakfast. Yes the backside faces a wall about 25 feet away but you don’t hear the horns blasting away in the morning on 50th. If he paid more, he could have had a room that faced the street. The bathroom is small but adequate and no plumbing rattle. Breakfast is better than Hampton Inn or Courtyard, and it is free in NYC. My lighting was fine, not inadequate. If you want luxury, stay across the street at the Benjamin or the New York Palace. This is a nice hotel, just not a fabulous hotel.',80112,00000000096),

The reservations agent, Miss Julie, was extremely pleasant & helpful. Our room was gorgeous, clean, fresh flowers & candy, and the bed was to die for ( I wanted to order one). They offer a 20% discount to those guests who choose to dine at Harry Cipriani’s, a nice bonus. Of couse, the location of the Sherry Nethrland is excellent, close to great shopping & restaurants. This comes in handy in any kind of inclement weather. The hiring process must be rigorous as every member of the staff we encountered was unfailingly courteous and professional. It was like walking back in time to the ’good old days’ when people took their jobs seriously and wanted to provide guests truly excellent service. We will be back, but perhaps I’ll go there with my husband next time as it a cozy, romantic place too. MH',93559,00000000022),

I come here often because my company puts all visiting staff here. 2. the bell man do not have good attitudes. Some of them look like they have side business and not paying attention. Once I had to demand that they carry my luggage as the guy talk away on the cell phone. 3. the wifi speed is slow. It is about 0.5 MB/sec. It is ok for emails but not if you want to watch a video. 4. it is noise because there is an outdoor cafe with people hanging out.

Spacious room (in NYC standard) with comfy bed and soft beddings; 3. Complimentary refreshments in room, which is a nice touch of the hotel. Bad points – 1. The housekeeping staff took away one of my tops by mistake. People make mistakes sometimes so I was not too upset that it happened. I was unhappy as I had to explain the incident to the reception 3 times before someone actually acted upon it – very disappointing given it is supposed to be a 5-star hotel. The receptionist told me that housekeeping could not find the top but then it was later returned to my room with no note of apologies or explanation; 2. Hotel staff in general was polite and professional but some of them (esp. lift attendants) were too stiff – you just couldn’t have a chit chat with them – not very friendly; 3. There was some cigarette smell lingering for a couple of days. When we rang the reception, they said it was the smell of the cleaning liquid. (really? Seriously? Are you kidding me?!!); 4. Bathroom is bit old and dated. Took 10mins before hot water would come thru every evening. The hotel staff recommended a diner called Gene’s on the 60th – absolute gem – must try. The hotel also offered 15% off if dine in “Bottega del Vino” next door. Please I beg you not to bother – the food was ok but all the waiters were so up themselves and arrogant and rude, which made the whole dining experience pretty awful.  Most of the guests at the hotel seemed rather miserable and took themselves too seriously, maybe this is why staff were not very laid back. Gotta loosen up, people.

It was extremely difficult even with GPS to find this Hotel the only indication that we saw that helped was the HS initials on the valet booth. Pulled up to the valet and was informed that the garage was at full capacity and that even though we needed to park handicap we would have to park two blocks away and tote our luggage to the hotel. When we finally made it inside to the hotel we were completely lost because you then have to tote your luggage up a wooden flight of stairs to check in on the second floor. We later learned that there was a side door that led to the elevators. A first time visitor like myself would have never guessed that...I traveled with a group of 6 and overall if you don’t mind early morning construction noise or occasional loud music from the club area or the courtyard then this is most definitely the place to stay.  I must say that we had a few minor hiccups during our stay and after we expressed our concerns to the Assistant General Manager he did go out of his way to personally make things right. So I will spare the details of the minor issues we faced and focus on the many positive. I would most definitely stay here again if I was looking for a weekend get-a-way spot for romance or a place to party with my girlfriends. Hotel Sorella is sleek, stylish and very innovative. I loved the design of the Hotel. My room was clean, modern and well stocked. We ordered breakfast one morning that was perfectly delish. I would recommend the vegetable omelet and the steak and eggs. The complimentary breakfast consist of all the fruits your heart desires, dry cereal and milk and pastries. Monnalisa is a great bar that has a very stylish atmosphere and great drinks.  I was a little disappointed with how early the surrounding restaurants close on the weekends.
